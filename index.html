          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>SAM is a private membership community for entrepreneur fathers who want to build great companies without sacrificing their families. We organize founder-dads into "Core Groups" of eight members who meet monthly for honest conversations about the unique challenges of being a founder and a father at the same time.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>YPO and EO are excellent organizations focused on business. SAM is specifically designed for the intersection of entrepreneurship and fatherhood. Every conversation, every event, every resource is built around helping you succeed at both. We're not a business group that sometimes talks about family—we're a brotherhood that integrates both.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We have members from pre-revenue to post-exit. What matters more than revenue is your commitment to building something meaningful while being a present father. We match you with founders at similar stages so conversations are relevant.</p>

            <p>Membership is an annual commitment. We share specific pricing during the application process because we offer different tiers based on company stage. We also have a scholarship program for earlier-stage founders who demonstrate exceptional commitment to the mission.</p>

            <p>We get it—founder life means travel. Members can join virtually when necessary, and we facilitate connections with SAM members in other cities when you're on the road. That said, the magic happens in person. If you can't commit to most meetings being in-person, SAM might not be the right fit yet.</p>

            <p>Core Group meetings are once monthly, typically 4 hours over lunch or dinner. Beyond that, engagement with the community and events is encouraged but flexible. We designed SAM knowing that your time is your scarcest resource.</p>
